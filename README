This repository contains implementation of a leetcode-like question.

This question asks you to add several edges into a directed graph to enable you to travel all nodes from the given node.

I saw this question in this Youtube video:

Idea:
1. Find strongly connected component (SSC) of this directed graph.    
2. Treat SSC as a independent node. Build directed graph for it.
   You will choose an airport as the representative node of a SSC.
3. Find all SSCs that have 0 in-degree. They are the nodes we need to create
   edges to.
 
Note that you cannot assume that the airports having 0 in-degree are the answer.
There might be an isolated cycle among airports. They all have 1 in-degree, but they are not reachable from outside.
